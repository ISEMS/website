# New Freifunk OpenMPPT hardware based on ESP32 with ISEMS firmware and WiFi
Freifunk has developed a new solar MPP tracking solar charger with build in WiFi and
we have developed ISEMS software based on FreeRTOS and Nodemcu for the ESP32 chip that it
is now based on.

The power consumption is just 0.6 W under full load when operating as an
accesspoint and 0.3 W when operating as a WiFi client.

Hardware prototype and software are already working fine, but the final hardware will
have an additional UEXT header, because the community has asked us for the
opportunity to add external sensors.
