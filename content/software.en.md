# Software
With help of the ISEMS-software, users can get an overview over the current state of their
solar powered installation. To do so, they join the local wifi and browse to the management
page. The page is optimized for mobile and provides a quick overview over the state of the installation

On the first page, all modules are listed and their state is shown. Should any of the modules
have any problems (e.g. an almost empty battery), this modules will be highlighted.

Last but not least there is a map view and a view with more detailed charts that serves as an
expert view.
